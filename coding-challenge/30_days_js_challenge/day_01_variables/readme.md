# Variables & Data types Feature Requests

## 1. Variable types Console log

Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

```javascript
var num = 10;
console.log(num);

let myName = "munna";

console.log(myName);

const myAge = 27;
console.log(myAge);

const details = {
  name: "munna",
  age: 27,
  address: "mirpur",
};

const arr = ["assign", "comeback", "u can do this munna"];
const err = null;
```

## 2. Reassignment Demo

Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment.

```javascript
let hello = 30;
const name = "munna";

hello = 40;
name = "not possible";
```
